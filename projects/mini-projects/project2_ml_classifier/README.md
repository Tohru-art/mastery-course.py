# Mini-Project 2: ML Classifier

> **Skills used:** scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Model Evaluation
> **Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

## Goal
Build a complete ML pipeline that trains and compares multiple classifiers on a real dataset.

## Requirements
1. Load a real classification dataset (Iris, Titanic, or your own)
2. Preprocess: handle missing values, encode categoricals, scale features
3. Train at least 3 different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
4. Evaluate all models with accuracy, F1, and ROC-AUC
5. Plot a comparison bar chart of model performance
6. Plot the confusion matrix for the best model
7. Save the best model with `pickle` or `joblib`
8. Write a 1-page markdown summary of your findings

## Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Data loaded and explored
- [ ] Missing values handled
- [ ] Features scaled appropriately
- [ ] 3+ models trained
- [ ] Evaluation metrics computed and compared
- [ ] Confusion matrix plotted
- [ ] Best model saved
- [ ] `findings.md` written
