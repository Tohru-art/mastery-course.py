# Module 10 — RAG, Agentic AI & Guardrails

> **This module is the heart of CodePath AI110.**
> These are the most in-demand AI engineering skills in industry right now.

## What You'll Build
- A RAG system that answers questions using your own documents
- An agentic workflow that can use tools autonomously
- A fine-tuning pipeline for a pre-trained model
- Guardrails to make AI systems safe and reliable

## Lessons
1. [RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation](lessons/01_rag.py)
2. [Agentic Workflows & Tool Use](lessons/02_agentic_workflows.py)
3. [Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models](lessons/03_fine_tuning.py)
4. [Guardrails & Responsible AI](lessons/04_guardrails.py)
5. [Putting It All Together](lessons/05_full_system.py)

## Exercises
- [Exercise Set 10](exercises/exercises_10.py)

## Setup
```bash
pip install anthropic openai chromadb sentence-transformers langchain
```

## Why This Matters
- RAG: Gives LLMs access to private/up-to-date knowledge without retraining
- Agentic AI: LLMs that can take actions (browse web, run code, call APIs)
- Fine-tuning: Customize a model for your specific task
- Guardrails: Prevent harmful outputs, ensure reliability
