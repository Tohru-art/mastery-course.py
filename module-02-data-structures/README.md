# Module 2 — Data Structures & Algorithms

> **Goal:** Understand how data is organized and how to work with it efficiently.
> Big O notation, common structures, and the algorithms used in every technical interview.

## Why This Matters for AI
- Choosing the right data structure is the difference between O(1) and O(n) lookups
- ML libraries (NumPy, PyTorch) are built on efficient data structures
- Coding interviews for AI/ML roles test DSA heavily
