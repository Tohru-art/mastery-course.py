# Module 7 — Machine Learning with scikit-learn

> **Goal:** Build, train, and evaluate real ML models.
> This is the core of CodePath AI110's ML literacy objective.

## Setup
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Lessons
1. [ML Workflow](lessons/01_ml_workflow.py) — The complete train/evaluate cycle
2. [Linear & Logistic Regression](lessons/02_regression.py)
3. [Decision Trees & Random Forests](lessons/03_trees.py)
4. [Feature Engineering](lessons/04_features.py)
5. [Model Evaluation](lessons/05_evaluation.py)
6. [Clustering](lessons/06_clustering.py)

## Exercises
- [Exercise Set 7](exercises/exercises_07.py)

## What You'll Be Able to Do
- Load a dataset, clean it, split into train/test
- Train multiple model types and compare them
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Tune hyperparameters with cross-validation
